# snakepet
hackapet submission (might submit it, it seems pretty bad ngl)

## what is it?
the original idea was "snake but with multiple rooms". turns out, room generation is difficult, especially when you're drawing directly to pixels on a screen! in the end, I settled for a harder version of snake, using the functions I had made for room generation as generated barriers and enemies.

## how to run it?
since it's pygame, i *should* be able to web-pack it with pygbag, but i don't think that works with the libs required for hackapet development. so, install the libs that hackapet needs (`pip install blinka-displayio-pygamedisplay adafruit-circuitpython-display-text`), then run `main.py`.

## screenshots
im writing this from my school laptop which highkey doesn't have the processing power to run OBS so have a screenshot or two
